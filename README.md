# Association-rule-mining-on-the-Cosmetic-Dataset

Association Rule Mining, as the name suggests,
association rules are simple If/Then statements that
help discover relationships between seemingly
independent relational databases or other data
repositories.
Association rule mining is a procedure which aims to
observe frequently occurring patterns, correlations, or
associations from datasets found in various kinds of
databases such as relational databases, transactional
databases, and other forms of repositories. The aim of this project is to carry out exploratory data
analysis on our data set to improve the quality of it.
Next, we will be finding interesting association rules
in our data set using the apriori algorithm. The three
metrics would be involved (support, confidence and
lift). We are going to further improve the quality of the
rules by checking for and removing redundancy in the
set of rules in order to arrive at the best set of rules.
Finally, we are going to compare how each rule
performs over the other.
